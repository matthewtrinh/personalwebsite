# Matthew's Personal Website

This site was created to give a brief introduction about me and showcase some projects to potential employers as well as my ability to quickly learn.

I did not know any HTML and CSS a few months ago and was able to create a fully working personal website through self-studying front-end development with the Odin Project. This personal website was embarked upon at the beginning stages of my self-study and is written mostly in HTML and CSS.
